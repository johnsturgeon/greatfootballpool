<H2>Objective</H2>
<p>
Hopefully this should be fairly obvious.  The objective is to finish the season with more <B>Total Points </B>than any other person participating in the pool.
<p>
Each week (around Friday) I will publish the new picks page.  Simply choose who you think will be the winner straight up.  The point spread is there to assist you, and to allow you to pick an upset.  But if you pick an underdog you <b>do not</b> get the vegas points.
</p>
<H2>Scoring</H2>
<p>

<B>Total Points</B> are the points scored when you add your wins, and your <B>bonus points.</b>
<h3>Bonus Points are calculated as follows:</h3>
<P>
You pick <B>ONE </B>upset (optional) - if it hits, you get one bonus point. If
the upset does not happen, you don't lose a bonus point, but you do lose
the game.</P>
<P>
You pick <B>ONE </B>lock (not optional) - if it hits, you get a bonus pt, but, if
you lock loses, then you LOSE a bonus pt.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you pick:<br>
<B>Lock:</B> Ravens<br>
<B>Upset:</B> Falcons<br>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<blockquote>
You <b>must</b> pick a lock every week.<br>
You don't have to pick an upset.
<P>At the end of the season, bonus pts will be added to the Wins to determine
who wins the league.</P>
